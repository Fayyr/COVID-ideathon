    <h1>JUDGING CRITERIA</h1>
    <p>Judging will be based on the following criteria, with equal weight assigned to each:</p>
    <h5>Innovation / Ambition</h5>
    <p>Was the idea unique, or a different take on an existing/similar app? What was added to the app that made it
      special or more useful? Was the idea behind the app ambitious? Creative? How well did the app execute upon the
      theme/category chosen?</p>
    <p>Judging will be based on the following criteria, with equal weight assigned to each:</p>
    <h5>User Interface / User Experience</h5>
    <p>Does the UI of the app look professional/fun, or is it sloppy? Is the app easy to use? Does the workflow of the app
    make sense, is it intuitive?</p>
    <h5>Overall Quality</h5>
    <p>Does the app work completely from start to finish? How many and how severe were any bugs encountered? Was
      anything in the app that wasn’t fully implemented, like a useless button that was supposed to do something? Did
      the team scope their app’s features well given the time frame of the Hackathon?</p>
    <h5>Quality of Pitch / App Impact </h5>
    <p>Does the app seem like something people would want to buy and use outside of the Hackathon? Was the team able to
      explain their idea and what the app actually did?</p>
    <h5>Usefulness / Practicality</h5>
    <p>How will it help modernize regulatory systems?</p>

  <div class="container problem-content text-center pb-5 my-5" data-aos="fade-up" id="faq" data-aos-duration="800">
    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <p>Judging will be based on the following criteria, with equal weight assigned to each:</p>
    <h5>Who should participate?</h5>
    <p>Anyone that has an interest in regulatory solutions in the energy and financial services sector. <br />

      Any companies or start ups that want to represent the organization with a team or friends from different
      organizations that want to come together as a team.</p>
    <p>Judging will be based on the following criteria, with equal weight assigned to each:</p>
    <h5>Can I bring a team?</h4>
     <p>Does the UI of the app look professional/fun, or is it sloppy? Is the app easy to use? Does the workflow of the
      app make sense, is it intuitive ?</p> 
      <h5>Overall Quality</h4>
        <p>Yes, though we have a limit of six members per team. You can bring your friends or you can team up with other
          hackers on site. However you choose to do it, be ready to hack!</p>
        <h5>Do we own your code?</h5>
        <p>No, all code is yours. We are here to enable innovation not kill it. </p>
        <h5>What is the goal of the hackathon? </h5>
        <p>To bring together the regulators, incumbents, start ups and anyone with an idea to help solve regulator
          issues. We want to create an environment that embraces new ideas and regtech solutions for the industries. A
          place for designers and developers to geek out with worrying about failure or affecting a company’s bottom
          line. We know it takes longer than a weekend, but this is a great start.</p>
        <h5>What do I bring?
        </h5>
        <p>Your laptop and any software you need.</p>
        <h5>Will there be food?
        </h5>
        <p>We will serve all main meals and coffee/tea. Bring anything you want to snack on during the event. </p>
        <h5>Should I bring clothes?
        </h5>
        <p>Expect to stay overnight, so bring what you need to get through the hackathon. We’ll provide some sleep
          spaces for those who need some shut-eye. Remember you’re in a public forum, so please act accordingly.
        </p>
        <h5>How late can I stay?
        </h5>
        <p>We want you to come back refreshed and raring to go on Sunday so we are closing the doors at 10pm on Friday
          and Saturday and re-opening at 8am on Saturday and Sunday</p>
