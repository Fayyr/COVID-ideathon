    <h5>Overall Quality</h4>
    <p>Does the app work completely from start to finish? How many and how severe were any bugs encountered?

    <h5>Quality of Pitch / App Impact    </h4>
    <p>Does the app seem like something people would want to buy and use outside of the Hackathon? Was the team able to explain their idea and what the app actually did?</p>
