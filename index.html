    <h1>JUDGING CRITERIA</h1>
    <p>Judging will be based on the following criteria, with equal weight assigned to each:</p>
    <h5>Innovation / Ambition</h5>
    <p>Was the idea unique, or a different take on an existing/similar app? What was added to the app that made it special or more useful? Was the idea behind the app ambitious? Creative? How well did the app execute upon the theme/category chosen?</p>
    <p>Judging will be based on the following criteria, with equal weight assigned to each:</p>
    <h5>User Interface / User Experience</h5>
    Does the UI of the app look professional/fun, or is it sloppy? Is the app easy to use? Does the workflow of the app make sense, is it intuitive?  
    <h5>Overall Quality</h5>
    <p>Does the app work completely from start to finish? How many and how severe were any bugs encountered? Was anything in the app that wasn’t fully implemented, like a useless button that was supposed to do something? Did the team scope their app’s features well given the time frame of the Hackathon?</p>
    <h5>Quality of Pitch / App Impact    </h5>
    <p>Does the app seem like something people would want to buy and use outside of the Hackathon? Was the team able to explain their idea and what the app actually did?</p>

    <p>Anyone that has an interest in regulatory solutions in the energy and financial services sector. <br/>

      Any companies or start ups that want to represent the organization with a team or friends from different organizations that want to come together as a team.</p>
    <p>Judging will be based on the following criteria, with equal weight assigned to each:</p>
    <h5>Can I bring a team?</h4>

    <h5>Overall Quality</h4>
    <p>Yes, though we have a limit of six members per team. You can bring your friends or you can team up with other hackers on site. However you choose to do it, be ready to hack!</p>
    <h5>Do we own your code?</h5>
    <p>No, all code is yours. We are here to enable innovation not kill it.  </p>
    <h5>What is the goal of the hackathon?    </h5>
    <p>To bring together the regulators, incumbents, start ups and anyone with an idea to help solve regulator issues. We want to create an environment that embraces new ideas and regtech solutions for the industries. A place for designers and developers to geek out with worrying about failure or affecting a company’s bottom line. We know it takes longer than a weekend, but this is a great start.</p>
      <h5>What do I bring?
      </h5>
      <p>Your laptop and any software you need.</p>

      </p>
      <h5>How late can I stay?
      </h5>
      <p>We want you to come back refreshed and raring to go on Sunday so we are closing the doors at 10pm on Friday and Saturday and re-opening at 8am on Saturday and Sunday</p>
